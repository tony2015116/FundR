<!-- 
Run this 'development' chunk

Store every call to library() that you need to run chunks line by line, as in a classical Rmd for analysis
-->

```{r development, include=FALSE}
library(testthat)
library(rvest)
library(httr2)
```

<!--
# Description of your package

This will fill the description of your package.
Fill and run the content of this chunk, before anything else. 

Note: when you will use other flat templates, this part will be in a separate file. Do not be surprised!
--> 

```{r description, eval=FALSE}
# Describe your package
fusen::fill_description(
  pkg = here::here(),
  fields = list(
    Title = "Fund Crawling Tool",
    Description = "An R package for Crawling Fund Data.",
    `Authors@R` = c(
      person("Guo Meng", , email = "tony2015116@163.com", role = c("aut", "cre")),
      person(given = "Guo Meng", role = "cph")
    )
  ),
  overwrite=T
)
# Define License with use_*_license()
usethis::use_mit_license("Guo Meng")
```

# Add one to any value

This is the first tool of our wonderful package. 
You can add `1` to any `value` using function `add_one()`.

<!-- 
This first section shows:

- the three parts necessary for a package: 'function', 'examples' and 'tests'.  
  + Note that the three following chunks have names accordingly.

-->

```{r function-add_one}
#' Add one to any value
#' 
#' @param value A numeric value
#'
#' @return Numeric. value + 1
#' @export

add_one <- function(value) {
  result <- value + 1
  return(result)
}
```

<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->

```{r examples-add_one}
add_one(12)
add_one(56)
```

<!--
Here are some unit tests to verify the function works as expected.
-->

```{r tests-add_one}
test_that("add_one works", {
  expect_equal(add_one(12), 13)
  expect_equal(add_one(56), 57)
})
```

That's it ! This the end of the documented story of our package. All components are there.

<!-- 
# Inflate your package

You're one inflate from paper to box.
Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()` 
-->


```{r development-inflate, eval=FALSE}
# Execute in the console directly
fusen::inflate(flat_file = "dev/flat_teaching.Rmd", check = T, vignette_name = "Basic Usage")
```

<!-- 
- Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
- Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
- Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
- Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory 
-->
